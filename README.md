# Read Anything on Your Kindle

Rayk takes all your big bad PDF files and turns them into cute Kindle friendly PDFs.

Uses [k2pdfopt](http://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/src/) and build using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/).

Made with <3 by Rishav.

## Installation

### Mac OS

You can get prebuilt binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/RishavT/rayk/releases) page

### Other OS

Currently Rayk does not support other operating systems (because of some hardcoded paths), but I will add cross platform support soon.

## Usage

### Step 1
Connect your Kindle to your Mac

### Step 2
Do any one of the following:
* Right click your target PDF file, Open With Rayk
* Add Rayk to your dock. Drag your PDF file to the Rayk icon on your Dock
* Open Rayk. Drag your PDF onto Rayk's main window.

### Step 3
Once you see a "Done" message, unplug your kindle and read your new well formatted PDF

# Read Anything on Your Kindle (RAYK)

A simple desktop application to format PDFs for your Kindle.

Uses [k2pdfopt](http://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/), which uses a different license, and hence is not shipped with this product and will be downloaded at runtime.

Built using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io).
